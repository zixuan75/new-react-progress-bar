# Info

You may have remembered the React Project ([last year](https://github.com/zixuan75/react-project)). Now, that was for no true purpose. This new project [link to main page](https://github.com/zixuan75/new-react-progress-bar) is what I mean for a project with a true purpose.

I started this idea with the old [react-progress-bar](https://github.com/zixuan75/react-progress-bar) project. This was the foundation for a whole new idea that I had.
I made a new project that was supposed to be more complicated than the old one. And there it is.
