# new-react-progress-bar

Hello! This is the new progress bar of React. I've made a few changes but you will find this a lot helpful. (This is a new version of the old archived [React Progress Bar project](https://github.com/zixuan75/react-progress-bar))

:rainbow: This is also one of the hardest projects I've worked on.

It is also currently the fastest-growing project I've worked on.
The project still doesn't work on phones but we're trying to fix that. Some of the contents that you see on computers overflow on phones.

**Note:** This won't work on phones because some of our content is too wide so sometimes it just won't work.
