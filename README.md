# new-react-progress-bar

Hello! This is the new progress bar of React. I've made a few changes but you will find this a lot helpful. (This is a new version of the old archived [React Progress Bar project](https://github.com/zixuan75/react-progress-bar))

:rainbow: This is also one of the hardest projects I've worked on.
I'm revisiting this project..... so soon I will be back.
The project still doesn't work on phones but we're trying to fix that. Some of the contents that you see on computers overflow on phones.

**Note:** This won't work on phones because some of our content is too wide so sometimes it just won't work.

To run it, you can go to [this link](https://32mbp.csb.app/).
Or, you can do it (Linux only) by installing NodeJS (>= 6.0.0) and NPM (>= 5.2.0).

Then run: `npx create-react-app my-app` (not `npm`). Delete all the my-app files and replace them with these files. Remove the ones that don't contain JS, CSS or HTML (**except** `package.json`). Then start npm by running `npm start`. Go to localhost:8000 and you're done!

You can also go to [the wiki](https://github.com/zixuan75/react-project/wiki).
